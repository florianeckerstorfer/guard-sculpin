Guard::Sculpin
==============

[Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard)::Sculpin automatically generates a [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io) site when a source file changes.


Installation
------------

Before you start make sure that you have Guard installed. It's best to use [Bundler](http://bundler.io) to install Guard and Guard::Sculpin.

Install the Guard::Sculpin gem:

```bash
$ gem install guard-sculpin
```

Add Guard::Sculpin to your Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'guard-sculpin', :require => false
```

Install by running Bundler

```bash
$ bundle
```

Add a sample guard definition to your `Guardfile`:

```bash
$ bundle exec guard init sculpin
```


Usage
-----

Guard::Sculpin has some options you can set.

- `:binary => 'vendor/bin/sculpin'`
- `:env => 'dev'`
- `:project_dir => '.'`

The default configuration assumes you used Composer to install Sculpin. If you have Sculpin installed globally you should change `:binary` to `sculpin`.

You can find more information on how Guard works in the [Guard usage documentation](http://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

### Example Guard definition

```ruby
guard 'sculpin' do
    watch(%r{^source/*})
end
```

*(This definition is installed when you run `bundle exec guard init sculpin`)*
